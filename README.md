# TopicTune
Topictune revolutionizes news aggregation by putting users in control, allowing them to meticulously shape their news feed through the exclusion of articles related to specific topics they deem uninteresting. This high level of personalization is facilitated by a Language Model (LLM), ensuring that users receive news that is not only up-to-date but also perfectly aligned with their individual preferences and interests.
It gives you the freedom to choose. You don't have to ban a channel or waste your time away clicking on the "not interested" button on news you don't see. Just add them to the exclusion list and we will route it through our LLM to check whether you want it or not.
